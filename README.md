# TimePickerValidation
Uses inline JavaScript to validate that the user is inputting a time within a specified time range.

I created this because I could not find a way online to validate user input into 'input type="time"' fields on the fly. 

This is a very basic version, and for simplicity I've only used JavaScript and no JQuery. In my actual project I did more styling such as changing the outline weight and colour of the selector, and I used CSS classes rather than HTML styling by using the '.AddClasses' method in the validTime function.

Feel free to modify this and use as needed.
